# Analysis of Wind Energy in Germany-Project

### Introduction
This analysis focuses on the wind energy data from northern and southern regions of Germany. The goal is to see the correlation and difference in the installled wind turbines, their production, specifications in both regions.

I chose the Bavaria(Southern) and Schleswig-Holstein(Northern) regions of the country. Here is the link to the datasets: \

Schleswig-Holstein Data: https://opendata.zitsh.de/data/llur72/WKA-OpenData_2019-12-10.xlsx \

### Conclusion
After the analysis, I can say that there is clear difference in the wind energy production of Southern(Highlands) and Northern(Coastal Areas). Turbines in coastal areas produces more energy than in bavarian region. \
Production also depends on the height of turbine if we analyze each region separately. Further study can be done by using data of different domains like weather conditions.
