# Project Plan

## Title
Wind Energy Production in Northern and Southern Germany.

## Main Question
What is the difference in the production of wind energy in coastal(North) and planes or elevated areas(South)?
## Description 
This analysis will help us determine the requirement of wind turbines generators in two parts of country. This will be beneficial to see what areas of north and south are producing more energy and needs more generators.
